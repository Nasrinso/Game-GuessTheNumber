# Game-GuessTheNumber
Simple game design
This game works in a way that you have to guess the numbers (0-9), which had been selected randomly by computer. If your guess is higher than the actual number it will be shown by red, if your guess is less than the actual number it will be shown by blue.
if you guessed correctly you will get the green color.
